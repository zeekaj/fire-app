---

### 3. Historical Backtest Chart ✅
**Purpose**: Show how plan would have performed in actual historical markets

**What It Does**:
- Runs 100 bootstrap simulations using 1926-2023 market data
- Reconstructs portfolio trajectories year-by-year
- Selects 8-10 representative scenarios to display
- Colors lines by outcome quality (red=worst, green=best)
- Provides historical context (references 1929, 2008 crashes)

**Technical Highlights**:

- Smart line selection algorithm (worst, 10th, median, 90th, best + random)
- Multi-line Recharts implementation
- Trajectory reconstruction from annual returns
- ~280 lines of TypeScript

**User Value**:

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy Comparison ✅
**Purpose**: Compare fixed vs guardrails withdrawal strategies

**What It Does**:
- Runs 1,000 Monte Carlo sims for fixed strategy
- Runs 1,000 Monte Carlo sims for guardrails strategy
- Displays side-by-side bar chart (3 metrics)
- Shows detailed comparison cards for both strategies
- Generates smart insights and recommendations

**Metrics Compared**:
- Success Rate (% of simulations that don't deplete)
- Median Final Portfolio (50th percentile outcome)
- 10th Percentile Final (worst-case non-catastrophic)

**Strategies Explained**:
- **Fixed**: Same inflation-adjusted withdrawal every year (predictable but rigid)
- **Guardrails**: Adjusts withdrawals ±10% when portfolio breaches 80%/120% bounds (flexible but variable)

**Technical Highlights**:
- Parallel simulation execution (2,000 total sims)
- Side-by-side BarChart with custom colors
- Dynamic insight generation based on comparison
- Custom tooltip formatting (% vs $)
- ~288 lines of TypeScript

**User Value**:
- Understand tradeoff between predictability and longevity
- See quantified improvement from adaptive spending
- Make informed decision about withdrawal flexibility
- Optimize for portfolio sustainability

**Typical Results**:
- Guardrails improves success rate by 5-15%
- Guardrails median final portfolio 20-40% higher
- Benefit increases with volatility and longer retirements

## Supporting Infrastructure

### Chart Data Transformers
**File**: `src/lib/sim/chartDataTransformers.ts` (279 lines)

**Purpose**: Bridge between simulation engine and chart components

**Key Functions**:
- `createNetWorthProjection()` - Manual year-by-year projection calculator
- `monteCarloToHistogram()` - Bins Monte Carlo results into histogram
- `getMonteCarloPercentiles()` - Extracts 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles
- `historicalToChartData()` - Reconstructs trajectories from historical returns
- Helper utilities: downsample, moving averages, summaries

**Design Rationale**:
The simulation library is optimized for performance and returns only summary statistics. The chart layer needs detailed year-by-year data, so we reconstruct it from scenario parameters. This separation of concerns keeps the simulation engine fast while giving charts the detail they need.

---

### Error Boundaries
**File**: `src/features/scenarios/components/ChartErrorBoundary.tsx` (65 lines)

**Purpose**: Isolate chart errors to prevent full page crashes

**Features**:
- React error boundary pattern
- Friendly fallback UI with error icon
- Technical details in expandable <details> section
- Each chart wrapped individually
- One chart error doesn't affect others

**Example**:
If the Historical Chart throws an error due to data issues, the other 3 charts continue working normally, and users see a friendly "Chart Error" message with the option to view technical details.

---

### Loading States
**Implementation**: Integrated in ScenarioDetailPage

**Features**:
- Spinner icon with rotation animation
- Clear message: "Running Simulations..."
- Context: "Analyzing 2,100+ scenarios across all strategies"
- Prevents layout shift (charts don't appear until ready)
- Smooth transition to loaded state

**Performance**:
- Total simulation time: ~200-400ms (2,100 simulations)
- Loading state typically shows < 1 second
- No UI freezing or blocking

---

## Integration & User Experience

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Scenario Comparison**: Can't compare multiple scenarios side-by-side yet (planned for todo #9)
2. **No Chart Export**: Can't download charts as images (future enhancement)
3. **Limited Historical Data**: Only 97 years of data (1926-2023), not all time periods represented
4. **Fixed Simulation Count**: 1,000 Monte Carlo runs (could make configurable)
5. **No Real-Time Updates**: Charts don't auto-refresh when scenario edited (requires navigation)

### Not Limitations (By Design)
- **Simulations Run Client-Side**: Intentional for privacy and speed (no server round-trip)
- **Results Not Persisted**: Intentional to avoid database bloat (recalculate on demand)
- **Chart Heights Fixed**: Intentional for consistent UX (not user-configurable)

---

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. **Scenario Comparison View** (todo #9)
   - Compare 2-4 scenarios side-by-side
   - Overlay projection lines
   - Show relative differences
   - Help users optimize scenarios

2. **Chart Export**
   - Download as PNG/SVG
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Include in PDF reports

3. **Advanced Guardrails Configuration**
   - Custom upper/lower bounds (not just 80%/120%)
   - Custom adjustment percentages (not just ±10%)
   - Different strategies (VPW, RMD, etc.)

### Medium Priority
4. **Configurable Simulation Counts**
   - Let users choose 100/1,000/10,000 runs
   - Trade speed vs accuracy

5. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - Show how small changes impact outcomes
   - "What if I save $100 more per month?"
   - Interactive sliders

6. **Tax-Aware Simulations**
   - Account for taxes on withdrawals
   - Roth vs Traditional comparisons
   - Tax bracket optimization

### Low Priority
7. **Chart Annotations**
   - Users can add notes to specific years
   - Mark important events (house purchase, etc.)

8. **Share Scenarios**
   - Generate shareable links
   - Embed charts on other sites
   - Social media sharing

9. **Historical Context Cards**
   - Click on historical line → see what happened that year
   - "This line represents 2008 financial crisis"
